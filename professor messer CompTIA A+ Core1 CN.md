# Comptia A+ Core 1 Course Notes

## 1- Laptob Hardware

### laptop batteries
- Lithium-ion (Li-ion) and Lithium-Ion polymer have no "memory effect" and charging battery doesn't deminish capacity

### laptop keyboard 
- they are mostly easy to replace as they connect to the laptop by a few screws and a ribbon cable
- be careful! the keycaps are very fragile

### laptop memory
- small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module (SO-DIMM)
- often easy to install
- sometimes they are soldered to the board (that's sad)

### laptop storage
- installing drives is often easy
- Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Magnetic disks, the traditional spinning drive platters, 2.5 form factors for laptops and 3.5 for desktops
- Solid State Dirve (SSD), no moving parts so silent, fast, and more reliable, always 2.5 inch form factor
- Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) uses an M.2 interface and utilizes the PCI-e so they are much faster
- SSDs sometimes use an M.2 interface
- you can image/ clone dirves using commercial or open source software, sometimes manufacturers make this sofware

### 802.11 wireless and bluetooth
- they use PCI interfaces
- the are wireless netowrks _duh_
- 802.11 or wi-fi (i know, surprising) is a Local Area Network (LAN)
- Bluetooth has a shorter range than wi-fi that's why it is a Personal Area Network (PAN)
- these cards use antennas that wrap in the screen to have better signal

### biometrics
- utilizes software and hardware
- finger print, facial recognition

### Near-Field Communication (NFC)
- short distance netword (4cm or less) used for small data transfer or authentication without typing a password

### camera/ webcam
- usually includes both audio and video

### notes:
```
you can be very familiar with a specific manufacturer
devices from the same manufacturer are often built similarly
```

## 2- Connecting mobile devices

### connection
- Universal Serial Bus (USB) like Micro, Mini B, Type A (most popular), Type C (the future, and thunderbolt) USBs
- apple proprietary cable is called lightning
- lightning and type C can be inserted in any orientaion

### wireless connection
- like bluetooth, wifi, NFC (which can be used as an access token or an "ID card")
- mobiles can be used as internet routers via the "Hot Spot" feature

```
sometimes mobiles are used for synchorization, backup and identification
```

## 3- Mobile device accessories

### stylus
- more percise, work with pressure and can have programmable buttons, just douple check the compatibility

### headsets
wireless
- connect via bluetooth

wired 
- USB connections (common in laptops)
- 3.5mm Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve (TRRS) connector
- Analog audio jack 
- Lightning port in iPhone

### speakers
- they are battery powered in mobiles, often stereo in more modern phones

### camera/ webcam
- internal (in laptops or phones) or external (in desktops)

### docking stations
- often use a specified interface to connect the laptop
- they use an external keyboard, mouse
- they add aditional functionality while avoiding cable issues

### port replicator
- adds more connectors like USB, Display, Ethernet
- I ususally call it a USB hub

### trackpad
- replaces the mouse and common in laptops
- they add aditional touch gestures and functionality

### drawing pad
- similar to a trackpad but comes with a stylus for aditional percision

## 4- Mobile device netwroks

### cellular networks
- they use antenna coverage and seperate land into "cells" and communicates with certain frequencies
- they provide data and voice connection, you can turn both of them off using the airplane mode
- 3G introduced new functionality as GPS, Mobile Televesion, Video conferencing, etc...
- 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) supports standard download rate of 150 Mbit/s, there is LTE Advanced which supports up to 300 Mbit/s
- 5G up to 10 Gbit/s with slower speeds from 100-900 Mbit/s

### Wi-Fi
- again, the 802.11 network
- support voice communications (good in absence of cellular networks)

### hotspot
- your device connects to a cellular network like 5G, and then other devices connect to it via Wi-Fi

### Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)
- it is a unique identifier for cellular devices
- it is often a tiny physical card
- has small storage to carry contacts and messages
- embedded SIM (eSIM) in newer devices cannot be removed (as the name suggests), changes the number via software

### bluetooth
- it connects between different devices via pairing process for one time manually then it happens automatically

### Global Positioning System (GPS)
- needs at least 4 satellites and determines location based on Longitude, Latitude, Altitude
- GPS isn't the only way to determine your locate, Wi-Fi and cellular towers are used too (You are not safe!)
